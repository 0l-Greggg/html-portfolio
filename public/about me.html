<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a 26 year old  Active Duty Airman. 
  I have served as a fighter jet mechanic for almost 6 years now.
  I began my journey in 2019 with my wife in Tucson, Arizona.

<p>I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember,
  and I have always been interested in how they are made. As a kid, one of the careers
  I was always interested in was video game development. But growing up on a cattle farm, 
  I felt that I needed a blue collar career field to feel fulfilled. So the last eight years 
  after graduation was spent destroying my body in construction and maintenance.

<p>As I got older and saw my future with both my father-in-law and dads bodies slowly giving out 
  on them, I decided that I didn't want to set that example for my future children. So at 26 years old,
  I started college for software development. My current goal is to be able to use my degree and certifications
  to design a website for my small business and start a career working from home with software development and freelance
  web design. I hope you all enjoy watching and support my journey! Thank you for reading!
